                A code which when added to the domain as a TXT record
                will signal to SES that the owner of the domain has authorised SES to act on
                their behalf. The domain identity will be in state "verification pending"
                until this is done. See below for an example of how this might be achieved
                when the domain is hosted in Route 53 and managed by Terraform.  Find out
