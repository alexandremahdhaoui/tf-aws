If configured with a provider default_tags configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.~> strongNOTE: AWS performs behind-the-scenes modifications to some certificate files if they do not adhere to a specific format. These modifications will result in terraform forever believing that it needs to update the resources since the local and AWS file contents will not match after theses modifications occur. In order to prevent this from happening you must ensure that all your PEM-encoded files use UNIX line-breaks and that certificate_body contains only one certificate. All other certificates should go in certificate_chain. It is common for some Certificate Authorities to issue certificate files that have DOS line-breaks and that are actually multiple certificates concatenated together in order to form a full certificate chain.In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:'
