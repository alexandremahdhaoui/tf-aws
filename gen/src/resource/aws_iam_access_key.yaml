            description: (Optional) Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form keybase:some_person_that_exists, for use in the encrypted_secret output attribute. If providing a base-64 encoded PGP public key, make sure to provide the "raw" version and not the "armored" one (e.g. avoid passing the -a option to gpg --export).

            description: Secret access key. This attribute is not available for imported resources. Note that this will be written to the state file. If you use this, please protect your backend state file judiciously. Alternatively, you may supply a pgp_key instead, which will prevent the secret from being stored in plaintext, at the cost of preventing the use of the secret key in automation.
