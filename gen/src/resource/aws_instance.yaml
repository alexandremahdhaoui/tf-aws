            description: '(Optional) Type of volume. Valid values include standard, gp2, gp3, io1, io2, sc1, or st1. Defaults to gp2.~> strongNOTE: Currently, changes to the ebs_block_device configuration of emexisting resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes and attachments of an EBS block to an instance, use the aws_ebs_volume and aws_volume_attachment resources instead. If you use ebs_block_device on an aws_instance, Terraform will assume management over the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, treating additional block devices as drift. For this reason, ebs_block_device cannot be mixed with external aws_ebs_volume and aws_volume_attachment resources for a given instance.Each ephemeral_block_device block supports the following:'
