                (Required) Name of the game server group.

            description: |-
                (Optional) Indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination.
                Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event,
                causing players to be dropped from the game.
                Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event
                of a forced game server group deletion.

                to the total capacity of a game server group.
                Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify
