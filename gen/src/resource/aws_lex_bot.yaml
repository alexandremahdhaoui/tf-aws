                Checksum identifying the version of the bot that was created. The checksum is not
                included as an argument because the resource will add it automatically when updating the bot.

                When you send a request to create or update a bot, Amazon Lex sets the status response
                element to BUILDING. After Amazon Lex builds the bot, it sets status to READY. If Amazon Lex can't
                build the bot, it sets status to FAILED. Amazon Lex returns the reason for the failure in the
                failure_reason response element.
