            description: (Required) Boolean whether to permanently apply this Glacier Lock Policy. Once completed, this cannot be undone. If set to false, the Glacier Lock Policy remains in a testing mode for 24 hours. After that time, the Glacier Lock Policy is automatically removed by Glacier and the Terraform resource will show as needing recreation. Changing this from false to true will show as resource recreation, which is expected. Changing this from true to false is not possible unless the Glacier Vault is recreated at the same time.
