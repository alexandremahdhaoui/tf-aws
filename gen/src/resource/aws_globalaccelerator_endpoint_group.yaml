            description: '(Optional) Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. See the AWS documentation for more details. The default value is falsestrongNote: When client IP address preservation is enabled, the Global Accelerator service creates an EC2 Security Group in the VPC named GlobalAccelerator that must be deleted (potentially outside of Terraform) before the VPC will successfully delete. If this EC2 Security Group is not deleted, Terraform will retry the VPC deletion for a few minutes before reporting a DependencyViolation error. This cannot be resolved by re-running Terraform.'
