        directory_user_id:
            description: (Optional) The identifier of the user account in the directory used for identity management. If Amazon Connect cannot access the directory, you can specify this identifier to authenticate users. If you include the identifier, we assume that Amazon Connect cannot access the directory. Otherwise, the identity information is used to authenticate users from your directory. This parameter is required if you are using an existing directory for identity management in Amazon Connect when Amazon Connect cannot access your directory to authenticate users. If you are using SAML for identity management and include this parameter, an error is returned.
            optional: true
            type: string
        email:
            description: (Optional) The email address. If you are using SAML for identity management and include this parameter, an error is returned. Note that updates to the email is supported. From the UpdateUserIdentityInfo API documentation it is strongly recommended to limit who has the ability to invoke UpdateUserIdentityInfo. Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of other users by changing their email address. This poses a security risk to your organization. They can change the email address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then reset the password through email. For more information, see Best Practices for Security Profiles in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
