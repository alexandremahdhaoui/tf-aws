        constraints:
            description: (Optional, Forces new resources) A structure that you can use to allow certain operations in the grant only when the desired encryption context is present. For more information about encryption context, see Encryption Context.
            type: string
        encryption_context_equals:
            description: (Optional) A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in subsequent cryptographic operation requests. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this constraint. Conflicts with encryption_context_subset.
            optional: true
            type: string
        encryption_context_subset:
            description: '(Optional) A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of subsequent cryptographic operation requests. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs. Conflicts with encryption_context_equals.In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:'

            description: The unique identifier for the grant.

        grantee_principal:
            description: (Required, Forces new resources) The principal that is given permission to perform the operations that the grant permits in ARN format. Note that due to eventual consistency issues around IAM principals, terraform's state may not always be refreshed to reflect what is true in AWS.
            type: string
        key_id:
            description: (Required, Forces new resources) The unique identifier for the customer master key (CMK) that the grant applies to. Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN.
            type: string
        name:
            description: (Optional, Forces new resources) A friendly name for identifying the grant.
            type: string
        operations:
            description: '(Required, Forces new resources) A list of operations that the grant permits. The permitted values are: Decrypt, Encrypt, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext, ReEncryptFrom, ReEncryptTo, Sign, Verify, GetPublicKey, CreateGrant, RetireGrant, DescribeKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, or GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext.'

        retiring_principal:
            description: (Optional, Forces new resources) The principal that is given permission to retire the grant by using RetireGrant operation in ARN format. Note that due to eventual consistency issues around IAM principals, terraform's state may not always be refreshed to reflect what is true in AWS.
