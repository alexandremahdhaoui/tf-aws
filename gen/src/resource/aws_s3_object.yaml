If referencing the aws_kms_key resource, use the arn attribute. If referencing the aws_kms_alias data source or resource, use the target_key_arn attribute.

            description: '(Optional) Target URL for website redirect.If no content is provided through source, content or content_base64, then the object will be empty.-> strongNote: Terraform ignores all leading /s in the object''s key and treats multiple /s in the rest of the object''s key as a single /, so values of /index.html and index.html correspond to the same S3 object as do first//second///third// and first/second/third/.In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:'
